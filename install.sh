# container) and the Bluetooth fixes. Run it on the headset in a terminal, from this repo.

SteamVR has to restart once, to load the 3D mouse driver and to start the input relay
before it. Restarting SteamVR closes everything open in VR, including this terminal if
it's in a VR desktop. Rebooting the headset works too.

Recommended: in Frametop Display Settings > Power, choose when the displays turn off
while the headset isn't used (for a stand or mount that covers its proximity sensor), and
turn on Stay awake while plugged in, so Steam doesn't put the headset to sleep while it
charges. The displays still turn off when you take the headset off.
