"""gazecheck: the gaze service's checks and calibration, in the panel fixed to the headset
(gaze/panel/ft-gazepanel; ft-gazed runs it). Every kind is made of dots shown at head-relative
directions: look at each one.

  quick   one dot in the middle of your view. It opens when the headset goes on: eyes seen
          for DON_DELAY after none for AWAY_MIN (SteamVR's tracker's variance for an eye under
          EYE_LOST). SteamVR's "HMD on" can't say: it repeats every minute or so, and it can
          stay on for hours with nobody in the headset. It also opens when our own tracker asks
          for a click (its "reseat": the headset may sit differently on your face now), at most
          once every QUICK_COOLDOWN, and on "quickcal" (Frametop Input Settings, or a mouse
          button or key combination mapped to Gaze quick check), and when a click's correction
          was past POINTER_GAZE_NUDGE_MAX (55 degrees; the helper's "recheck"): the tracker is
          far off. Ignored, it closes after QUICK_TIMEOUT and changes nothing.
  five    the middle and four around it, when the first FIVE_COUNT lessons after a quick check
          were all over FIVE_LIMIT degrees off: the quick check didn't fix it.
  full    the calibration, as the gaze probe's: three rounds, dark, medium and bright (pupil
          size, and the tracker's error with it, changes with brightness), each the middle and
          a ring of six (SteamVR's tracker) or eight (ours, whose fit goes wrong past its dots)
          RING degrees out, half that in the middle round, turned 20 degrees a round. It opens
          when gaze mode comes on without a calibration for the tracker in use, and on
          "calibrate". Frametop's screens hide while it runs. Quitting it while there's still
          no calibration turns gaze mode off (POINTER_GAZE=0); turning it on again reopens it.

  fit     the headset fit check (on "fitcheck", Check headset fit on the Gaze page): live, a
          card per eye (tracked or lost, the tracker's signal, how much of the last 10 s it was
          seen) and hints, from the gaze probe's Headset fit (gaze/fitcheck.py), while you
          adjust the headset. A left click or Meta+J runs its guided check (dots, then looks
          down, up, left and right); a right click or Meta+K closes it, as does FIT_TIMEOUT.

The quick check's dot captures itself: from CHECK_SETTLE after it shows (the eyes getting
there), once the gaze has held within CHECK_SPREAD for CHECK_WINDOW (the probe's max spread and
capture time). It's the gaze holding still that counts, not where the tracker puts it, so it
works however far off the tracker is; a left click or Meta+J (the pointer helper's
"calaccept") takes it now. The full calibration's and five's dots wait for that click: you
click when you're looking at the dot (the user asked for that: a steady gaze isn't always on
the dot), and the gaze held still up to then is taken (ACCEPT_SPREAD). They wait as long as
it takes, up to CLICK_IDLE. A right click or Meta+K ("calquit") closes the panel. The pointer hides meanwhile ("calpanel 1",
renewed every second; the helper shows it again by itself when that stops).

What a capture teaches:
  our tracker   quick and five: a click ("click T YAW PITCH", like a pointer lesson); full:
                calib-start, a calib-point for each dot, calib-fit (its calibration)
  SteamVR's     quick and five: a lesson for each eye, like the pointer's; full: each source's
                calibration fitted from the dots (gazecal.Correction, the probe's way), saved
                to calibration.json, and the lessons start over on top of it
Either way, how far off each eye was goes to the eye bias, and each capture to the lesson log.
