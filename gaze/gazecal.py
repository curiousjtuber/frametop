    Each click on an element is a measurement: you were looking at that element when you

    whole error there. Whatever the calibration doesn't already explain (the residual) is
    fitted with the same quadratic terms. Every term but the offset is held close to zero
    (ridge), so one click shifts the whole correction and more clicks bend it. Whatever is
    still left near a click is added within a few degrees of it: on the Frame, errors less
    than 3 degrees apart are alike, and ones further apart are unrelated. Recent clicks count more (a
    half-life counted in clicks), so it follows SteamVR's gaze as that drifts or relearns.
    Replayed on logged points: a calibration from an earlier session was 4.95 degrees off;
    one click brought that to 2.3, five to 1.6, twenty to 1.2.

    A big element says little about where on it you looked, so each axis is weighted by the
    element's size along it: a list row 12 degrees wide barely counts sideways.

    Putting the headset back on moves the error (SteamVR starts its eye model over each
    time, and the headset sits a little differently), so clicks from before the last time

    the lost eye's yaw where it was and gives it the other eye's pitch, so the gaze moves
    half as far sideways as the eyes do (seen: the right eye swung 5 degrees, the combined
    gaze 2.5). Set 2's eyes are each eye's own reading. While both are seen, this learns what
    each eye reads against the combined gaze (an offset: half the angle between the eyes,
    plus how differently the tracker reads each), in 10 degree cells of where that eye
    looks, blended over the four nearest; while one is lost, the other eye plus its offset
    stands in for the combined gaze. So the rest (fixation lock, calibration, lessons)
    carries on as if nothing happened.

    On a recording, one eye alone came out 1.1 degrees (median) from both eyes' gaze, 0.8
    over a tenth of a second of a steady look, and a little more jittery (0.31-0.37 degrees
    against 0.28). Carrying on the offset from just before a loss did no better: what's

    the mean of both was 0.65 degrees off (median), the left eye alone 0.96, the right 1.11.
    So a bias leans instead of choosing: "left" or "right" counts that eye LEAN times the
    other (on those clicks, 2:1 toward the better eye cost about 0.03 degrees, toward the
    worse one about 0.13). "auto" weights each
    by the inverse square of its RMS miss at the last KEEP lessons, once both have MIN, and
    alike until then. Each miss is measured before its lesson teaches anything, so each is a
    fresh test. On SteamVR's own test (2026-09-29) its calibration dots said the left eye was
