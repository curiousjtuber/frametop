#!/bin/bash
# Runs on the Frame host. Serves the Frametop desktop's primary screen (the one with the
# taskbar) over VNC for clients like RealVNC Viewer or macOS Screen Sharing. No VNC server
# here can capture KWin directly, so this bridges through krdp: Xvnc (a virtual X screen
# served over VNC) runs a FreeRDP client connected to krdpserver (remote-desktop.sh) on
# 127.0.0.1; RDP clients on the LAN or the tailnet connect to the same server directly.
# Both run in the dev container. VNC listens on the tailnet address only.
# Started by frametop-session.sh when REMOTE=1, after remote-desktop.sh.
#
# krdp streams the whole workspace (every screen). Its --monitor would stream one screen,
# but krdp 6.7 then maps the pointer as if that screen sat at 0,0, so clicks miss on a
# screen placed lower or further right. Instead the VNC screen is the primary's size, and
# the workspace-sized RDP window inside it is shifted so the primary fills it. The pointer
# maps 1:1. When the layout changes, the VNC screen resizes and the RDP client reconnects.
#
# The RDP client runs only while someone watches. While connected, krdp captures and
# H.264-encodes every redraw in software, about 60% of a core, with FreeRDP and Xvnc adding
# about 30% more, even with no VNC viewer. krdp starts its capture per RDP connection and
# stops it when the connection closes, so it idles without one. So FreeRDP starts when a
# VNC client connects (the screen is black for the few seconds that takes) and stops
# VNC_IDLE_SEC (45) seconds after the last one leaves. Xvnc has no hook for clients, so ss
# counts them: whenever Xvnc writes to its log (it logs each connection), every second
# while FreeRDP runs, and every 5 seconds otherwise. The log only wakes this script up;
# what it says doesn't matter.
