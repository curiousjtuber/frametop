"""Input relay for the Steam Frame: stable virtual devices, the 3D pointer, device rules.

SteamVR opens /dev/input/event* only when it starts and never hotplugs, so a
Bluetooth mouse that sleeps and reconnects (new event nodes) stops working
until SteamVR restarts. This relay creates a virtual mouse and a virtual
keyboard through /dev/uinput once, before SteamVR starts, and feeds them from
the physical devices as they come and go.

Every USB or Bluetooth mouse and keyboard is a candidate. A physical device is
identified by its Bluetooth address (EVIOCGUNIQ) or USB bus:vendor:product:name,
so all its event nodes share one role (the Swiftpoint Z3 has a mouse node and a
keyboard node for its extra buttons). Roles, from ~/.config/frametop-input.json
(written by the Frametop Input Settings app):
  pointer      grabbed; drives the universal 3D mouse (default for devices with a mouse node)
  passthrough  keys go to the desktop; grabbed only while typing goes there, otherwise only observed,
               e.g. for the Meta dashboard shortcut (default for keyboards; the shortcut is off
               unless META_DASHBOARD=1 is in ~/.config/frametop.conf)
  ignore       not grabbed, only observed for identification in the settings app
Buttons and keys of pointer devices go through a per-device map to actions
(left, right, middle, back, scroll_up, scroll_down, dashboard, recenter,
pointer_toggle, follow_toggle = head follow on or off, gaze_toggle = gaze mode on or off
(the pointer goes where you look; see pointer/helper/ft-pointer.cpp), gaze_precision = while
held, the pointer stops where you look and the mouse steers it, and the release clicks there,
gaze_drag = the same, but pressed at once, so it drags ("precision|gazedrag mouse|keyboard 1|0"
to the helper), gaze_left and gaze_right = keyboard clicks at the gaze: a tap clicks where you
look; held, the pointer stops there and your head steers it (it stays put in your view), and
the release clicks; held still for half a second, it's a real press that your head drags
("gazekey left|right 1|0" to the helper; by default Meta+J and Meta+K, DEFAULT_KEY_BINDINGS),
gaze_quickcal = the gaze service's one-dot check ("quickcal" to @ft_gazed), sens_up, sens_down,
layout_reset = put the desktop screens back in their saved layout, screens_toggle = hide or show the desktop screens,
keyboard_toggle = open or close Frametop's keyboard, float_toggle = float the desktop window under the
pointer (else the active one) in VR, or put it back if it floats, dock_all = put every floating
window back (both to ft-floatd, @frametop_float), profile:NAME = switch to that profile (ft-layout
use NAME: its screens and apps; docs/profiles.md), key = pass through as a key, none).

Frame controller buttons can be mapped too ("controller_buttons": {"right/a": action} in the
rules file; any action but key and the gaze ones, GAZE_ACTIONS: gaze mode is a mouse feature,
docs/gaze-controllers.md). So can key combinations on any keyboard ("key_bindings":
{"29+56+34": action}, evdev codes joined by "+", modifiers first and left-hand codes for
either side, here Ctrl+Alt+G): the combination does the action, and its last key isn't typed.
A rules file without "key_bindings" gets DEFAULT_KEY_BINDINGS (Meta+J: gaze_left, Meta+K:
gaze_right, Meta+Shift+F: float_toggle); one with its own, even an empty one, doesn't. The float
actions work without pointer mode too. A combination with Meta also sends the desktop an F24 press
and Meta's release right away: so letting go of Meta doesn't open Plasma's launcher, and a gaze
click isn't Meta+click (KWin's window move and resize). Another key while Meta is still held gives
the desktop Meta back. The controllers aren't input devices here, only SteamVR sees
them, so the pointer helper reads them with SteamVR input and sends "vrbtn <button> 1|0".
It only takes the buttons the relay tells it to ("vrbind <button>..." to @ft_pointer_helper,
sent on start, reload, and when the helper says "vrhello"), and only while no game runs,
unless "controller_in_games" is true in the rules file (then a mapped button no longer
reaches games; see pointer/helper/vrbuttons.h).

In gaze mode outside games, the helper keeps the pointer ("gazeawake 1", repeated every 5
seconds; "gazeawake 0" or silence ends it): the pointer isn't released when the mouse is idle.
Typing on a keyboard sends the helper "typing" (at most 4 times a second): it takes no hand
pinches right after a key, since typing touches thumb to index like a pinch.

Keys also go to ft-screens (@ft_screens, the Frametop desktop's compositor), which
types them into the desktop screen that has focus: from pass-through keyboards, and
keys a pointer device passes through. Typing goes to the panel clicked last, and
ft-screens says which ("keyboard desktop|steam" on the control socket, every second).
While it's the desktop, pass-through keyboards are grabbed, so gamescope, which reads
every keyboard itself, doesn't type them into its focused app too. Without word from
ft-screens for 3 seconds they're released. With SHARE_KEYS=1 in ~/.config/frametop.conf,
a grabbed keyboard's keys also go out as "key <code> <value> <device name>" datagrams on
@frametop_keys, for programs that watch every keyboard for a hotkey and lose it to the grab.
It's off by default: any local process that binds that name first gets every key typed
into the desktop.

Frametop's keyboard (ft-screens' key panel): the desktop's input method (input/ft-textinput)
says "textfield 1|0" when a text field on the desktop gains or loses keyboard focus, and
the relay tells ft-screens to open ("vrkeyboard show") or close ("vrkeyboard hide") the
keyboard, depending on "vr_keyboard" in the rules file: "always", "no_keyboard" (the
default: only while no pass-through keyboard is connected; a program's uinput keyboard
doesn't count), "button" (only the keyboard_toggle action opens it), or "never"
(keyboard_toggle does nothing either). With "vr_keyboard_persist" (the default), it stays
open when the text field loses focus, until its Close key, keyboard_toggle, or a layout reset
(ft-layout apply) closes it.

Volume keys, from every device that has them (the headset's own buttons included),
are handled here: wpctl steps the default output. Nothing else may see a volume key,
because gamescope aborts on one when no window has keyboard focus, which ends the
whole VR session. Devices with a keymap (the headset's gpio-keys, USB and Bluetooth
keyboards) get their volume entries remapped to unused stand-in codes, so their
other keys keep working for SteamVR; a device without a keymap that has only volume
keys (the headset's pmic_resin) is grabbed. The keymaps go back when the relay exits.

Pointer mode (POINTER=1 in ~/.config/frametop.conf) sends pointer devices to
the ft-pointer helper (pointer/helper), which drives the ft_pointer
SteamVR driver. With POINTER=0, pointer devices go to the virtual mouse and
keyboard instead.

Control socket (abstract datagram @frametop_relay, JSON replies to the sender):
  devices           list event nodes with id, name, kinds, role, grabbed
  watch <seconds>   stream input events from every candidate node (identification)
  reload            re-read both config files, re-apply roles, tell the helper
  vrcapture <s>     take every controller button for s seconds (0: stop), so the settings
                    app can capture one; watchers see them as events with id frame_controller
  vrbtn, vrhello, gazeawake   from the pointer helper (above)
  textfield 1|0     from the desktop's input method (above)

Runs on the Frame host as a user service (frametop-input-relay.service). The
virtual devices are parked in systemd's file descriptor store, so a relay
restart gets the same devices back and SteamVR never loses them. The service is
Type=notify: READY=1 goes out only after the devices exist, so SteamVR (ordered
after it) always finds them. Dependency-free: Python standard library plus the
kernel's evdev and uinput interfaces.
