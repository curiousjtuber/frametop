"""The hand recorder's session runner (DESIGN.md: "Processes during a session", "Files", "The
script", "Feedback while recording", "Controls").

It reads script.json, starts what the session needs (ft-camd and a tracking ft-hands, only if
they aren't running), and runs the sections in order. Each section is one take: a recording
ft-hands child process (--record-only, 10 sets a second) plus prompts.jsonl, take.json and the
panel's poses.jsonl. The headset panel (ft-handpanel) shows the prompts; the live hands file
gives feedback ("I can't see your left hand").

Plain Python, standard library only: ft_handrec.py imports it, and it runs from the command line
for testing:

  python3 hands/rec/session.py --dry-run --speed 20 --next-after 0.2   # no processes: prints the panel commands
  python3 hands/rec/session.py --ring /tmp/ring --base /tmp/hr        # ft-ringplay's frames, no headset needed

Before anything starts it runs the camera check (hands/camcheck.py) and won't start while the
upper cameras are off (--ignore-cameras overrides it). If the hand-size section's first step sees
no hands at all, it stops that step and asks: try again, or stop (DESIGN.md, "Camera check").

Step mode (the default) shows each step and waits for Next (Space in the window, n or Enter
here); a 3-2-1 countdown, recorded, then the hold. Only the countdowns and holds are recorded:
each is a part of the take's recording (sets-N.bin). --auto is the old timed flow.

All _ns times are CLOCK_MONOTONIC nanoseconds.
